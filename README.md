# Probabilistic Machine Learning for Modeling Uncertainty and Cost in Vision-Based Inspection Systems

This research project explores how measurement uncertainty in automated vision inspection systems affects manufacturing decision-making and operational costs.  
The approach integrates probabilistic machine learning methods with stochastic modeling to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, and links these uncertainties to cost impacts such as scrap, rework, and false accepts.

## Repository Name
`ml-uncertainty-vision-inspection`

## Objectives
- Simulate synthetic measurement datasets with controlled aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.  
- Apply classical statistical approaches (Gauge R&R, confidence intervals) as a baseline.  
- Develop machine learning models (logistic regression, ensembles, Bayesian methods) for uncertainty quantification.  
- Translate prediction uncertainty into decision rules and cost modeling.  
- Compare classical vs ML-based strategies in terms of false reject/false accept rates and expected costs.  

## Tools & Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyMC/Probabilistic frameworks)  
- Git + VS Code for version control and development  
- Jupyter/Colab for experiments and visualizations  

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress â€” dataset generation and baseline ML model completed. Next steps: uncertainty quantification and cost simulations.
